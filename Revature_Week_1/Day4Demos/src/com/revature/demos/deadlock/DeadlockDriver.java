/*
 * The Dining Philosophers problem is one of the classic problems used 
 * to describe synchronization issues in a multithreaded environment 
 * and illustrate techniques for solving them. 
 * 
 * There are five silent philosophers (P1 – P5) sitting around a circular 
 * table, spending their lives eating and thinking.
 * 
 * There are five forks for them to share (1 – 5) and to be able to eat, 
 * a philosopher needs to have forks in both his hands. After eating, he 
 * puts both of them down and then they can be picked by another philosopher 
 * who repeats the same cycle.
 * 
 * The goal is to come up with a protocol that helps the philosophers achieve
 * their goal of eating and thinking without starving to death (which will happen
 * if they deadlock).
